# Welcome to My Portfolio!
Hello ! 

I'm Mathis Spataro, a passionate software and graphics engineer on the verge of completing my Master's degree. 
Currently in the midst of my final internship, I eagerly seek employment opportunities starting mid-September 2024.

## Who am I
My academic background consists of a year of Physics and Mathematics preparatory class, followed by a solid multi-disciplinary training in computer science, encompassing a wide range of domains within the field. Over the past year and a half, I chose to specialize in computer graphics and 3D, driven by my deep-seated interest in graphics and video games. 

This curriculum has equipped me with robust, multidisciplinary knowledge,
enabling me to collaborate effectively with various computer science professionals as well as lead or work autonomously on software architecture and 3D features.

While my focus has been on graphics and 3D, my curiosity extends to a multitude of fields :
- From a technical standpoint, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity, AI, and infrastructure. This diverse range of interests fuels my passion for continuous learning and innovation.
- Beyond computer science, I also enjoy learning physics, mathematics or biology. I have played the guitar for over 8 years, recently started learning the saxophone, and I always seek new perspectives in literature, arts or sociology.

# Content of this repository

In addition to my on-going project, I have selected two projects from my final year of university to offer context for the content of my CV. 
These projects were done in collaboration with Lea Roullier, a fellow student at University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.

## [Renderer](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Renderer-Banner-Project)
I am currently working on a banner project to showcase my skills.
It is a rendering software intended to evolve into a small game engine. Besides my personal interest, I chose this topic for its complexity, 
which will certainly allow me to draw from my various skill sets and further develop them.

## [Mesh Refinement Software](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Mesh-Refinement) 
Our mesh refinement software is based on the Delaunay criterion, Lawson's algorithm and Ruppert's algorithm, and demonstrates my ability to implement complex algorithms and optimize mesh structures in collaboration with others.

## [Texture Generator and Classifier](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Texture-Classifier)
This project is based on image masking techniques and a K-means algorithm. It showcases my skills in image processing, machine learning, and algorithm implementation in collaboration with others.

The following entries are reports and videos from multiple projects I have contributed to during my masters degree. I have included these to provide an overview into many topics I have tackled during my time at Claude Bernard University.

## [Terrain generation tool](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/Terrain%20generation%20report.pdf)
Currently in french, it will most likely be translated in english in the future. This is a report of the terrain generation features we implemented through our terrain generation tool project, such as erosion and semi-realistic tree placement.

## [VR game and motion capture](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/VR%20Project%20Report%20and%20summary.pdf)
To discover VR gear and motion capture usage in projects, we created a beat saber (video game) clone which is shown working in [this video](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/Beat%20saber%20clone%20demo.mp4).

## [Game design document and trailer for a video game](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/GDD%20virtuos.pdf)
I had the opportunity to develop a small game in real-world conditions over a 3-weeks period thanks to an association between Claude Bernard University and the game development company Virtuos. This document was used for planning and slightly edited through development, and with the trailer [available here](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/Silent-Shadows-Trailer_final.mp4), makes for most of my work on the project.

## [Implicit surface editor](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/Implicit%20surfaces.pdf)
Currently in french, it will most likely be translated in english in the future. This report was handed to our teacher following our implicit surface project. The goal was to put into practice the implicit surface knowledge acquired through class. It provides an overview of the features we implemented but is very succint as requested by our teacher.

## [Trait recognition in gait using a neural network](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/documents/blob/main/Research%20initiation%20project%20report.pdf)
Currently in french, it will most likely be translated in english in the future. A report of our research initiation project from first year of masters in which we studied the feasability of a real time application of a gait characteristics recognition neural network.
