# Welcome to My Portfolio!
Hello! I'm Mathis Spataro, a passionate software and graphics engineer on the verge of completing my Master's degree. 
Currently in the midst of my final internship, I eagerly seek employment opportunities starting mid-September 2024.

## Who I am
My academic journey began with a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals encompassing a wide range of domains within the field, 
following a year of Mathematics and physics preparatory class. Over the past year and a half, I chose to specialize in computer graphics and 3D, 
driven by my deep-seated interest in graphics and video games. 

This curriculum has equipped me with robust, multidisciplinary knowledge,
enabling me to collaborate effectively with various computer science professionals as well as lead or work autonomously on software architecture and 3D features.

While my focus has been on graphics and 3D, my curiosity extends to a multitude of fields :
- From a technical standpoint, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity, AI, and infrastructure. This diverse range of interests fuels my passion for continuous learning and innovation.
- Beyond computer science, I also enjoy learning physics, mathematics or biology. I have played the guitar for over 8 years, recently started learning the saxophone, and I always seek new perspectives in litterature, arts or sociology.

# Content of this repository
## Renderer
I am currently working on a banner project to showcase my skills, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Renderer-Banner-Project). 
It is a rendering software intended to evolve into a small game engine. Besides my personal interest, I chose this topic for its complexity, 
which will certainly allow me to draw from my various skill sets and further develop them.

In addition to this on-going project, I have selected two projects from my final year of university to offer context for the content of my CV. 
These projects were made in collaboration with Lea Roullier, a fellow student at University Claude Bernad Lyon 1.

## Mesh Refinement Software
You can find our mesh refinement software [here](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Mesh-Refinement).
It is based on the Delaunay criterion, Lawson's algorithm and Ruppert's algorithm, and demonstrates my ability to implement complex algorithms and optimize mesh structures in collaboration with others.

## Texture Generator and Classifier
You can find our Texture generator and classifier [here](https://github.com/Mathis-Spataro/Texture-Classifier).
It is based on texture filtering techniques and a K-means algorithm. It showcases my skills in image processing, machine learning, and algorithm implementation in collaboration with others.
